We have an id_rsa file which is the private key file.

Send our private key to john :
python2 /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.john

then bruteforce the john hash file :
john id_rsa.john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

and you can show the private keyword with :
john --show id_rsa.john
